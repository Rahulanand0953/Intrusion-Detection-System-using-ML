This project is focused on Network Intrusion Detection System. 

Machine Learning is a vast field and comprises of number of algorithms which can perform supervised as well as unsupervised tasks. For Network Intrusion Detection, we have used a few of the Supervised Algorithms to detect anomaly in the network activity. These algorithms will predict the occurrence of a potential attack with a certain probability and will thus help the network administrator prepare well.
